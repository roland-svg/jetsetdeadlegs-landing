    Terms of Service – Travellers
  </h1>

  <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mb-2">
    <strong>Last updated:</strong> 23 December 2025
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mb-8">
    These Terms of Service apply to travellers and other end users of JetSet
    Dead Legs. They are provided on a best‑efforts basis. We are an early‑stage
    company without in‑house legal counsel yet, and we will refine these terms
    as our product and regulatory guidance evolve.
  </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-3 text-white">
      1. Who we are
    </h2>
    <p>
      JetSet Dead Legs is operated by JETSET DEAD LEGS.COM LTD (“we”, “us” or
      “our”), a company registered in England and Wales, company number
      16884349, with its registered office at Office 15937, 182–184 High Street
      North, East Ham, London E6 2JA, United Kingdom.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-2">
      JetSet Dead Legs is a technology platform that connects travellers with
      independent, licensed aircraft operators offering private charter flights,
      including “empty leg” or “dead leg” flights. We are
      <strong>not</strong> a direct air carrier, charter operator, or licensed
      broker. All flights are operated by third‑party operators who remain
      solely responsible for the operation and safety of each flight.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      2. Acceptance of these Terms
    </h2>
    <p>
      By accessing or using our website, app, or any services we provide as a
      traveller (including creating route alerts, making enquiries or bookings),
      you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not
      use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      3. Our role
    </h2>
    <p>
      We provide tools that allow you to search for, receive alerts about, and
      request private jet flights from independent operators. Our role is
      limited to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Providing the platform for discovery and communication</li>
      <li>
        Providing secure payment flows via our payment provider (Stripe) where
        applicable
      </li>
      <li>
        Supporting verification and trust signals about operators based on
        information they provide and other checks we may perform
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      We do not operate flights, do not guarantee availability or pricing, and
      are not responsible for any decisions made by operators, aviation
      authorities, or other third parties.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      4. Eligibility
    </h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into legally binding
      contracts under the laws that apply to you in order to use the Service as
      a traveller.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      5. Your account and information
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you create an account or submit a request, you agree to provide
      accurate, current, and complete information and to keep it up to date.
      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
      details and for all activity that occurs under your account.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You must notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorised access to your
      account.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      6. Route alerts, enquiries and bookings
    </h2>
    <p>
      You may use JetSet Dead Legs to set route alerts and submit enquiries or
      booking requests to operators. In doing so, you acknowledge and agree
      that:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        Any prices and availability shown in the app are indicative and may
        change at any time until confirmed by the operator.
      </li>
      <li>
        A booking is only confirmed when the operator (and, where applicable,
        our payment provider) has accepted your request and payment has been
        authorised.
      </li>
      <li>
        The contract for carriage is between you and the operator, not between
        you and JetSet Dead Legs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      7. Payments, fees and refunds
    </h2>
    <p>
      Where you pay for a flight through our platform, payments are processed by
      our payment provider (Stripe) and may be subject to additional terms
      imposed by Stripe.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Unless stated otherwise in the booking flow or operator’s terms:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        You authorise us and our payment provider to charge your chosen payment
        method for the amount displayed at checkout, including any applicable
        fees and taxes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cancellation, change and refund rules are determined by the operator
        and/or the fare you choose. These will be shown or explained as part of
        the booking process where possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our commission or service fee (if any) is generally non‑refundable
        unless required by law.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-2">
      We may hold certain funds on behalf of the operator until the flight is
      completed or another agreed milestone is reached, after which the
      operator is paid out.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      8. Behaviour and compliance
    </h2>
    <p>You agree that you will:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        Comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including aviation,
        customs, immigration and security requirements
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide accurate passenger information requested by the operator or
        authorities
      </li>
      <li>
        Treat crew, staff and other passengers with respect and follow all
        lawful instructions given by the operator or crew
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Operators may refuse carriage or offload passengers in accordance with
      their own policies and legal obligations. We are not responsible for
      decisions made by operators or authorities in this regard.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      9. Prohibited use
    </h2>
    <p>You must not use the Service to:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Engage in unlawful, fraudulent or abusive activity</li>
      <li>
        Harm, threaten or harass any person, or encourage others to do so
      </li>
      <li>
        Interfere with or disrupt the Service, our systems, or other users’
        access
      </li>
      <li>
        Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or scrape our systems or
        content in a way that goes beyond normal use
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      10. AI tools and recommendations
    </h2>
    <p>
      JetSet Dead Legs may use AI‑powered tools to suggest routes, highlight
      options or provide information. These tools are designed to assist your
      decision‑making, not to replace human judgement.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      While we aim to keep information accurate and up to date, we cannot
      guarantee that every suggestion or piece of information will be complete,
      current or suitable for your specific situation. You are responsible for
      checking details with the operator and making your own decisions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      11. Disclaimers
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided “as is”
      and “as available”, without any warranties of any kind, whether express
      or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Without limiting the above, we do not warrant that:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>The Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free</li>
      <li>
        All prices, availability, or other information displayed will be
        accurate or complete at all times
      </li>
      <li>
        Any particular flight, route, operator, or aircraft will be available
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      12. Limitation of liability
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability where it would be
      unlawful to do so, including for death or personal injury caused by our
      negligence, or for fraud.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Subject to the above, and to the maximum extent permitted by law:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        We are not liable for any acts, errors, omissions or breaches by
        operators or other third parties, including the operation of flights and
        compliance with aviation regulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will not be responsible for any indirect, incidental, special or
        consequential loss, or loss of profits, revenue, or data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our total aggregate liability to you arising out of or relating to the
        Service will not exceed the total amount of fees (if any) that you have
        paid to us in connection with the relevant booking or transaction, or
        one hundred pounds (£100), whichever is greater.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      13. Suspension and termination
    </h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time if we
      reasonably believe you have breached these Terms, pose a risk to other
      users or operators, or where we are required to do so by law or by a
      partner.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You may stop using the Service at any time and may request that we close
      your account. Some provisions of these Terms will continue to apply after
      termination (for example, those relating to liability and dispute
      resolution).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      14. Changes to these Terms
    </h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will change
      the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and may provide additional
      notice (for example, in the app).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Your continued use of the Service after changes have taken effect means
      you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      15. Governing law
    </h2>
    <p>
      These Terms and any non‑contractual obligations arising out of or in
      connection with them are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The
      courts of England and Wales will have non‑exclusive jurisdiction over any
      disputes.
