          7. How we protect your data
        </h2>
        <p>
          We use a combination of technical and organisational measures to help
          protect your data, including:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-1 space-y-1">
          <li>Encryption in transit using HTTPS</li>
          <li>
            Access controls and least‑privilege principles for internal tools
          </li>
          <li>Secure storage of verification documents and operational data</li>
          <li>Password hashing and secure authentication practices</li>
          <li>Monitoring for unusual activity and potential abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">
          However, no online service can be completely secure. If we become aware
          of a data breach that affects your rights or freedoms, we will notify
          you and the relevant authorities where legally required.
        </p>

        <!-- 8. Retention -->
        <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">
          8. How long we keep your data
        </h2>
        <p>
          We keep your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide
          the Service, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
          enforce our agreements.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          In practice, this means for example:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-1 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Account data is retained while your account is active. If you close
            your account, we will delete or anonymise your personal data unless
            we need to keep certain information for legal or regulatory reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transaction and billing data may be retained for up to seven years
            (or longer if required by applicable law).
          </li>
          <li>
            Verification and safety‑related records may be retained for as long
            as reasonably needed to demonstrate compliance and manage risk.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">
          When we no longer need personal data, we will securely delete or
          anonymise it.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>

          rights in relation to your personal data:

            <span class="font-semibold">Portability:</span> request that we
            provide certain data in a structured, commonly used, machine‑readable
            format or transfer it to another service where technically feasible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Withdraw consent:</span> where we rely
            on consent (for example, some marketing), you can withdraw it at any
            time.

        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">

          You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data
          protection authority. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s
          Office (ICO).

          11. AI features and automated decision‑making
        </h2>
        <p>
          JetSet Dead Legs uses AI‑powered tools to improve the experience for
          travellers and operators (for example, by suggesting routes or
          providing decision support).
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-1 space-y-1">
          <li>These tools are designed to assist humans, not to make binding decisions on their own.</li>
          <li>
            We may use operational and usage data, often in aggregated or
            pseudonymised form, to train, tune, or validate these features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where we use third‑party AI services, we seek to minimise the
            personal data shared and implement appropriate safeguards.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">
          If we introduce automated decision‑making that has legal or similarly
          significant effects on you, we will provide additional information and,
          where required, seek your explicit consent.
