  </h1>

  <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mb-2">
    <strong>Last updated:</strong> 23 December 2025
  </p>

  <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 mb-8">
    These Terms of Service apply to operators and other business users of the
    JetSet Dead Legs Operator Command Centre. They are provided on a
    best‑efforts basis. We are an early‑stage company without in‑house legal
    counsel yet, and we will refine these terms as our product and regulatory
    guidance evolve.

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-3 text-white">
      1. Who we are and our relationship
    </h2>
    <p>
      JetSet Dead Legs is operated by JETSET DEAD LEGS.COM LTD (“we”, “us” or
      “our”), a company registered in England and Wales, company number
      16884349, with its registered office at Office 15937, 182–184 High Street
      North, East Ham, London E6 2JA, United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      JetSet Dead Legs is a technology platform that connects travellers with
      independent aircraft operators. We do not hold ourselves out as an air
      carrier or charter broker and we do not exercise operational control over
      any aircraft or flight. As an operator, you remain solely responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Operational control and safety of each flight</li>
      <li>Regulatory compliance, including AOC and insurance</li>
      <li>
        Your own contracts with travellers and any brokers or partners you work
        with
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      2. Acceptance of these Terms
    </h2>
    <p>
      By creating an operator account, accessing the Operator Command Centre or
      listing flights on JetSet Dead Legs, you agree to be bound by these
      Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company, you
      confirm that you are authorised to do so.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      3. Eligibility and regulatory status
    </h2>
    <p>
      To use JetSet Dead Legs as an operator, you must hold and maintain all
      licences, approvals, and insurance required to operate the flights you
      list, including a valid Air Operator Certificate (AOC) or equivalent
      authorisation in each relevant jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You agree to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Provide accurate and up‑to‑date information about your AOC status</li>
      <li>Promptly notify us of any suspension, variation, or revocation</li>
      <li>
        Provide supporting documentation (such as AOC and insurance) upon
        request for verification purposes
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      4. Operator account and access
    </h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for all activity that takes place under your operator
      account. You must:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Ensure that only authorised personnel have access</li>
      <li>Maintain the confidentiality of login credentials</li>
      <li>
        Immediately inform us if you believe your account has been compromised
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      5. Listings and content
    </h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for all content that you submit, post, or display on
      JetSet Dead Legs, including flight legs, pricing, schedules, aircraft
      details, marketing copy, and images (“Operator Content”).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You agree that all Operator Content will be:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Accurate, not misleading, and kept up to date</li>
      <li>Compliant with applicable laws and advertising standards</li>
      <li>
        Respectful of third‑party rights, including intellectual property and
        privacy rights
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free licence to use,
      reproduce, display and distribute Operator Content on or in connection
      with JetSet Dead Legs for the purpose of operating and promoting the
      platform. You retain all rights in your content otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      6. Bookings, customers and service levels
    </h2>
    <p>
      JetSet Dead Legs may allow travellers to submit enquiries, hold requests,
      or bookings for your flights. You acknowledge that:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        You are responsible for responding to requests in a timely and
        professional manner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any contract of carriage or charter agreement is between you and the
        traveller (and/or any broker involved), not between the traveller and
        JetSet Dead Legs.
      </li>
      <li>
        You remain responsible for communicating applicable terms and
        restrictions (including baggage rules, dangerous goods, cancellation
        policies and any special conditions).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-2">
      We may provide basic service‑level expectations (for example, response
      time norms) as part of our operator documentation and may factor these
      into visibility and ranking within the platform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      7. Pricing, fees and payouts
    </h2>
    <p>
      You control the base prices you set for flights and services offered
      through JetSet Dead Legs. We may discuss recommended price ranges with you
      but you remain responsible for ensuring pricing is compliant and
      commercially acceptable.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Our commercial model may include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        Subscription fees for certain operator tiers (for example, Solo,
        Pro, or Fleet plans)
      </li>
      <li>
        A commission or application fee on successful bookings facilitated
        through the platform
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      The exact fees and commission structure applicable to you will be
      communicated separately (for example, via operator pricing pages,
      onboarding materials, or your subscription plan) and form part of these
      Terms.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Payments from travellers will generally be processed via Stripe and
      disbursed to you (less our fees and any applicable Stripe charges) via
      Stripe Connect or similar arrangements. You agree to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Complete Stripe onboarding accurately and promptly</li>
      <li>
        Maintain valid bank and business details in Stripe and in your operator
        profile
      </li>
      <li>
        Comply with Stripe’s own terms and policies, which are separate from
        these Terms
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      8. Cancellations, changes and refunds
    </h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for setting and communicating your own policies on
      cancellations, schedule changes, and refunds, subject to applicable law.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Where we surface certain policy information within the app (for example,
      whether a fare is refundable), you must ensure that the information you
      provide is accurate and kept up to date. You agree to honour the policies
      that are presented to travellers through the platform at the time of
      booking.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      9. Compliance, safety and conduct
    </h2>
    <p>
      You represent and warrant that you will:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        Operate flights in full compliance with applicable aviation laws,
        regulations and standards
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintain all required certificates, approvals, and insurance at all
        times
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that crew and operational personnel are properly qualified and
        trained
      </li>
      <li>
        Treat travellers and our team fairly and respectfully, and handle
        complaints promptly
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      We reserve the right to suspend or remove operators, listings or content
      where we reasonably believe there is a safety or compliance risk, or where
      credible concerns have been raised by travellers or regulators.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      10. Data, confidentiality and privacy
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your use of traveller and platform data is also governed by our
      <a href="/privacy.html" class="underline text-gray-200 hover:text-white"
        >Privacy Policy</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You agree to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        Use traveller data obtained through JetSet Dead Legs only for the
        purpose of fulfilling bookings and providing related customer service
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect
        such data
      </li>
      <li>
        Comply with applicable data protection laws in jurisdictions where you
        operate
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      We will treat commercially sensitive information you share with us
      (including pricing strategies and operational details) as confidential and
      use it only for purposes related to operating and improving JetSet Dead
      Legs, except where disclosure is required by law or with your consent.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      11. Platform tools, AI features and uptime
    </h2>
    <p>
      We provide the Operator Command Centre and related tools, including AI
      features that may suggest pricing, repositioning strategies or which
      legs to prioritise. These tools are decision‑support only; you remain
      responsible for all final decisions and actions.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      While we aim for high availability, we do not guarantee that the platform
      will be available continuously or free from errors. Planned or unplanned
      downtime may occur, particularly during our early‑stage development.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      12. Intellectual property
    </h2>
    <p>
      We and our licensors own all rights in the JetSet Dead Legs platform,
      including software, branding, design, and underlying data models, except
      for Operator Content and third‑party materials.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer or create
      derivative works of the platform except as permitted by mandatory law or
      with our written consent.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      13. Indemnity
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless
      JetSet Dead Legs, its directors and employees from and against any
      claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
      fees) arising out of or in connection with:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>Your operation of flights and aviation activities</li>
      <li>Your breach of these Terms or of applicable laws</li>
      <li>
        Any inaccuracy or omission in Operator Content or information you
        provide
      </li>
      <li>
        Any claim brought by a traveller or third party arising from your acts
        or omissions
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      14. Limitation of liability
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability where it would be
      unlawful to do so, including for death or personal injury caused by our
      negligence, or for fraud.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Subject to the above, and to the maximum extent permitted by law:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>
        We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or
        consequential losses, or loss of profits, revenue, goodwill or data.
      </li>
      <li>
        We are not liable for any acts, errors or omissions of Stripe or other
        third‑party providers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our total aggregate liability to you arising out of or relating to the
        Service will not exceed the greater of (a) the total fees paid by you to
        us in the twelve (12) months before the event giving rise to the claim,
        or (b) five hundred pounds (£500).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      15. Suspension and termination
    </h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your operator account, remove listings, or
      limit access to certain features if we reasonably believe that:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
      <li>You have breached these Terms or our policies</li>
      <li>
        There are concerns regarding safety, regulatory compliance, fraud or
        misuse
      </li>
      <li>
        We are required to do so by law, a regulator, or a partner (such as
        Stripe)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      You may stop using the Service and request closure of your operator
      account at any time, subject to honouring any confirmed bookings and
      outstanding obligations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      16. Changes to these Terms
    </h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update
      the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and may provide additional
      notice (for example, via email or an in‑app banner).
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Continued use of the Operator Command Centre after changes take effect
      constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3 text-white">
      17. Governing law
    </h2>
    <p>
      These Terms and any non‑contractual obligations arising out of or in
      connection with them are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The
      courts of England and Wales will have non‑exclusive jurisdiction over any
      disputes.
